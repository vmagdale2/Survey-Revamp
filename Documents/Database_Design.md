# Database Design Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the database design for the **Survey Revamp** project. The database supports features such as storing, maintaining and access. It is implemented using Google BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage PgAdmin, SQL  and PostgreSQL. The implementation  adheres to best practices for normalization, scalability, and performance.

## Database Schema
The database schema consists of the following tables and their relationships. Below is the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
