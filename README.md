# **Survey Project: Modernizing Survey Processes**

---

## **Project Description**
This project focuses on enhancing the survey process for conference participants. The traditional paper-based survey system was transitioned to a virtual format using open-source tools and AI-driven insights. The revamped process aims to improve **efficiency**, **response rates**, and **real-time analytics** while enabling actionable feedback to shape future conferences.

## **Objectives**
- Transition from paper-based to virtual surveys.
- Leverage open-source tools to modernize the data collection process.
- Utilize AI-driven insights to provide **actionable feedback**.
- Enable **real-time analytics** for immediate insights during conferences.
- Achieve higher participant **response rates**.
- Assist the company in attaining a presentation rating of **"Excellent"**.
